# NFExplorer

**NFExplorer** is a research project designed to analyze and compare lexical and semantic embedding methods across two distinct datasets: a **product catalog (CATMAT)** and **electronic invoices (NFes)** from the state of Acre, Brazil. This research evaluates the relevance and accuracy of embeddings in diverse scenarios, exploring the distinct characteristcs of each dataset. Where the product catalog presents standarized and long descriptions while the invoice dataset present short and unstandardized descriptions.

## Research Overview

The study focuses on:
- Comparing **lexical** and **semantic** embedding techniques to evaluate their effectiveness in representing structured and unstructured data.
- Utilizing datasets from diverse domains:
  - **CATMAT**: A product catalog containing structured data about materials and services.
  - **Electronic Invoices (NFs)**: Unstructured data from fiscal documents in Acre, Brazil.
- Conducting experiments to measure embedding performance, emphasizing real-world applications like product categorization and document analysis.
